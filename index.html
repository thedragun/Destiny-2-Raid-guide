      <h3>Capture the flag</h3>
        <p> Its time to play a game of capture the flag. </p>
           <p>The starting point changes every weekly reset each door leads to an activity. you need to split your team into two groups. </p>
           <p>One group is going to capture flags from standard bearers around the map and deliver the flags to the door of the activity that your going to.</p>
           <p>Meanwhile the other team will be defending the captured flags from cabal trying to retake the flag.</p>


              <h3>Guard Dogs</h3>
                <p>Your first step is to clear the room of enemies.now head to the back of the room. you'll need to seperate your team again into a duo and a group of four. the duo will grab the two crystals while the four head down the hole in the roof and grab the four spores from the room. Your goal here is to charge the spores from the flowers aroud the room. looking towards the door you came in there are six flowers two immediantly left and right of the safe room on the right side theres one in the cave and one at the end of the room. on the left the flowers are just along the left wall. sneak around the dogs(NOTE: do NOT touch on the trails of footprints SECOND NOTE: walk do not run) these spores will boost your damage use these damage boosts to kill the dogs. when you start your attack on the dogs(or get spotted) a timer will start you need to get back into the spore room before the timer runs out our you all die. once all the dogs are dead the encounter is complete. </p>

              <h3> Royal Baths</h3>
                <p>so there as you enter the baths on the left and right there are going to be four baths. two on the left and two on the right. with a large room in the center. what your ging to do is split the party up so that there is a guardian on each platform. the two remaining guardians will be the runners. what your going to do is raise the chains on the sides of the capture points. but there a catch the liquid on the floor will drain your health. you've probaly noticed the orb floating above the capture point. this will give you immunity to the drain effect. there is also a orb in the center room. so the two runners will be assigned to a side of the room each. then they will dimiss a plate holder who will then run to the center room and grab the buff orb. and dimiss the other plate holder  </p>

                <h3>The Gauntlet </h3>
                <p>so you start on the elevator taking you to the gauntlet room the team is goin to need to split up again assign two people to each section of the room(the sections are the bits of the room with the three triangles) you have to stand on the pedistals( floor circles) there are going to be cabal psions with white sheilds. the ones on the ground need to be melee'd but the ones that appear in the air can be shot. someone will then go into the gauntlet. the goal? get to the end. if you make it return to the alter in the center of the room, repeat until. all the lights are on. </p>

                <h3>Calus</h3>
                <p>the fight starts when you shoot the cup out of calus hand. then you are sent to the mindscape three orbs will dictate who leaves(jump into them) they just go into ad clear the people in the mindscape need to kill psions before you're thrown into air(which is certain death) you need to call out the symbol on your calus head. one person on the outside needs to punch the psion on the plate of the symbol that was not called out. the people in the mindscape will be swarmed by little skulls shoot as many as you can.</p>

                <h4>The Damage Phase.</h4>
                </p> stand on a plate and start to damage calus. when he charges an attack switch plates and continue. when he reaches about %50 health he will reveal his "true nature" shifting the critical spot from his head to his chest. </p>

    <p>note: accessable through the Dreaming City.</p>

    <h3>The first encounter: kalli</h3>

    <p>when you first enter the room the first thing you will notice is the big pit in the center of the room surounded by hanging symbols. there are also nine plates around the room with symbols above them. look its not that hard just step on the plates of the corrisponding symbols and don't die until a knight spawns then kill the knight to clear the plate. occasionally kalli will come over to throw salt on you but she can be repelled with the classic method of pretending your not home and hiding or the american classic of greeting her with bullets. </p>
