          <p>
            Standard damage phase procedure is essentually having these things:
          </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A Well Warlock:<br>
          having a Warlock running the Well of Radience(middle tree dawnblade) to drop during the damage phase will improve results dramaticly.
          </li>
          <br>
           <br>
          <li>A bubble titan:
          <br>
          a titan running top tree sentinel shoud drop a bubble for the weapons of light buff. the bubble should be place some where not intrusive like with the well between the bubble and the boss or off to the side.</li>
          <br>
           <br>
          <li>A high dps weapon:
          <br>
          preferably an exotic heavy like whisper or if your coordinated enough and have them a xenophage and divinity setup (one player using divinity and all the others using xenophage). other options include: izanagis burden, outbreak perfected (you might all need to us it to be effective), anarchy, cluster rockets (any rocket launcher that has the cluster bomb perk), swords...just swords,

      <h3>Capture the flag</h3>
            <p>
              Its time to play a game of capture the flag.
              The starting point changes every weekly reset each door leads to an activity. you need to split your team into two groups.
              One group is going to capture flags from standard bearers around the map and deliver the flags to the door of the activity that your going to. Meanwhile the other team will be defending the captured flags from cabal trying to retake the flag.
            </p>


              <h3>Guard Dogs</h3>
                <p>
                  Your first step is to clear the room of enemies.now head to the back of the room. you'll need to seperate your team again into a duo and a group of four. the duo will grab the two crystals while the four head down the hole in the roof and grab the four spores from the room. Your goal here is to charge the spores from the flowers aroud the room. looking towards the door you came in there are six flowers two immediantly left and right of the safe room on the right side theres one in the cave and one at the end of the room. on the left the flowers are just along the left wall. sneak around the dogs(NOTE: do NOT touch on the trails of footprints SECOND NOTE: walk do not run) these spores will boost your damage use these damage boosts to kill the dogs. when you start your attack on the dogs(or get spotted) a timer will start you need to get back into the spore room before the timer runs out our you all die. once all the dogs are dead the encounter is complete.
                </p>

              <h3> Royal Baths</h3>
                <p>
                  so there as you enter the baths on the left and right there are going to be four baths. two on the left and two on the right. with a large room in the center. what your ging to do is split the party up so that there is a guardian on each platform. the two remaining guardians will be the runners. what your going to do is raise the chains on the sides of the capture points. but there a catch the liquid on the floor will drain your health. you've probaly noticed the orb floating above the capture point. this will give you immunity to the drain effect. there is also a orb in the center room. so the two runners will be assigned to a side of the room each. then they will dimiss a plate holder who will then run to the center room and grab the buff orb. and dimiss the other plate holder.
                </p>

                <h3>The Gauntlet </h3>
                  <p>
                    so you start on the elevator taking you to the gauntlet room the team is goin to need to split up again assign two people to each section of the room(the sections are the bits of the room with the three triangles) you have to stand on the pedistals( floor circles) there are going to be cabal psions with white sheilds. the ones on the ground need to be melee'd but the ones that appear in the air can be shot. someone will then go into the gauntlet. the goal? get to the end. if you make it return to the alter in the center of the room, repeat until. all the lights are on.
                  </p>

                <h3>Calus</h3>
                  <p>
                    the fight starts when you shoot the cup out of calus hand. then you are sent to the mindscape three orbs will dictate who leaves(jump into them) they just go into ad clear the people in the mindscape need to kill psions before you're thrown into air(which is certain death) you need to call out the symbol on your calus head. one person on the outside needs to punch the psion on the plate of the symbol that was not called out. the people in the mindscape will be swarmed by little skulls shoot as many as you can.
                  </p>

                <h4>The Damage Phase.</h4>
                <p>
                  stand on a plate and start to damage calus. when he charges an attack switch plates and continue. when he reaches about %50 health he will reveal his "true nature" shifting the critical spot from his head to his chest.

<!--the last wish-->
  <div id="wish" class="guides">
    <div class="textbox , borders">
    <h1>Last Wish</h1>

    <p>Accessable through the Dreaming City.</p>

    <h4>Eyes of riven:</h4>

    <p>
      there are special enemys called eyes of riven. they drop an orb that will function as a weapon theres a primary fire, you can use your grenade for a slam and you can hit your super to throw the orb. this will be used for some mechanics.
    </p>

    <h3>The first Encounter: Kalli</h3>

      <p>
        when you first enter the room the first thing you will notice is the big pit in the center of the room surounded by hanging symbols. there are also nine plates around the room with symbols above them. look its not that hard just step on the plates of the corrisponding symbols and don't die until a knight spawns then kill the knight to clear the plate. occasionally kalli will come over to throw salt on you but she can be repelled with the classic method of pretending your not home and hiding(getting off the plate) or with bullets.
      </p>

    <h4>Damage phase: </h4>

      <p>
        Once all the sybols have been clensed and the words "kalli is summoning an ontological weapon" then you can start damaging her go though standard damage phase procedure. and defeat kallis.
      </p>

    <h3>Encounter Two: Shuro Chi</h3>

      <p>
        your going to want a mix of wave clear and boss damage here. top tree storm caller or a middle tree sunbreaker do wonders. Now there will be a timer on the left of your screne if that hits zero you will wipe. once youre done clearing three crystals will appear around shuro chi choose three players to be crystal bearers they will stand on the plates around the boss and fire the crystal at the player to their left this will cause the boss's sheild to drop. crystal bearers need to be quick when dropping the sheilds because standing on the plates will damage them. you've probably noticed that the bosses health bar is segmented you need to do one segment each one of these damage phases. once either you die or you remove a segment of shuros health bar she will switch songs. the eye of riven knight that appeared dropped an orb when she switchs songs the player using the orb should hit their super button to throw the orb at shuro interrupting the wipe. chase and repeat. soon you will reach a puzzle room you need to stand on the plates corrisponding to the missing parts of the mural. you also need to stand on the plates at the same time. then you just repeat for all the segments.
      </p>

    <h3>Encounter three: Morgeth</h3>

      <p>
        Forout the fight with Morgeth he will be gaining strength a good run will see you entering the damage phase when he is at about 30% strength.
        <br>
         <br>
        Triggering the damage phase for Morgeth requires you to collect taken strength stop Morgeth from collecting it. You can only hold two without dying. Morgeth will occasionaly target a guardian who has taken strength traping them in a tornado. you can use the eye of riven weapon to free them from the tornado, this come with a cost of gain said persons stacks of taken strength. becareful when "cleansing" a player because if you pick up another stack of taken strength you will die. you can start the damage phase with a taken strength buff that spawns where the buff that started the fight did.
     </p>

      <h4>Damaging Morgeth:</h4>

      <p>
        There are two options when damaging Morgeth the first is a one phase strategy and a multi phase strategy.
        <br>
         <br>
        The one-Phase Strategy is just placing a well of radience halfway between the rally flag point and Morgeth. have player run code of the commander to block axion darts that will be sent towards you. while the rest of the team lay into Morgeth.
        <br>
         <br>
        The multi-phase strategy is pretty much the same but you throw a eye of riven at him before he reach 100% or the eye of riven buff gets to its tenth stack then repeat until dead
      </p>

    <h3>Encounter four: The vault</h3>

  <P>
    Step one: choose three people to read. the other three just kill things like the unimportant barbarians you are. choose a platform around the center of the room now read your middle symbol out loud use the guide below:
    <br>
     <br>
    The person with the symbol that you called out on the left or right of their panel needs to call out that they have that symbol then the person with the symbol in the middle will have to deliver the buff that their plate needs.<br>

    If the persons symbol is called out on the left then they need a penumbra buff.
    <br>
     <br>

    If it's called out on the right then it needs an antumbra
    <br>
     <br>


    Now the actual fight starts, after a short while two of the side rooms will be walled off the team needs to move into this room and clear adds. In the room will be your old friend: the eye of riven leave him till last. When he's all that remains every one except for the one whos plate belongs to that section of the room. When the buff is picked up a wall will rise blocking off that room. But another will open tell the player on the inside what section is opened so they can exit through it and dunk at their plate(Grenade button). There are also knights that will come to destroy a plate. KILL THEM BEFORE THEY REACH THE PLATE. This is very important if you fail to stop them you will wipe. Repeat this three more times and you'll be done. Note: you have to reread the symbols before each "round".
  </p>

    <h3>Riven</h3>

      <p>
        There are six plates around the room. The objects behind you dictate the room you will be entering (tree and crystal) when you drop down the first thing you would notice is the giant pillar in the center of the room. Once you reach the bottom split up between the two rooms. Once in the room if riven come through the taken wall then you get to deal with her first. If she's accompanied by tenticles then you get to have tenticle attacks if not then you have to deal with fireballs. To deal with the tenticles then have everyone jump when one slams down and then lay into the stuck tentile. If its fire breath then after a few fireballs the mouth will glow red this is your chance to give her a good meal of damage. After the phase an Eye of Riven will spawn killing it will drop a buff.
        <br>
         <br>
        If your fighting Riven second don't kill the eye of Riven until you hear your team-mates call out which eyes are glowing. You will need to shoot these eyes. Once you know which eyes are glowing feel free to murder your captain. You will go through a damage/stunning phase. After you finish the damage phase you need to shoot the eyes your team-mates called out, you need to be perfect here. If you shoot the wrong eye, you wipe. if you wait too long, you wipe.
      </p>

    <p>
      After riven has been defeated on both sides assign a player to hold the buff and a player to look through the glass at the back of the room(we'll call them the observer). You will see symbols. The player holding the buff should see a symbol tell the observer what the symbol is and they will direct you to the appropriate buff zone. Press grenade to dunk. All that happen before will happen again so if you fought riven first then you come second. Also when dunking the buff the left over player from last time will need to swap roles with the person who dunked last time
    </p>

    <h3>The second phase</h3>

    <p>
      You should pop back into the starting room where wave of Ogres and Goblins will spawn. Kill the goblins first as they can sheild the Ogres. Chain your supers on these waves. Eventually Riven will show up flash two eyes and leave this will repeat two more times remember all the eyes you will need to shoot all of them. when riven shows up shoot her mouth for about five seconds then shoot her eyes.
      <br>
       <br>
      When the damage phase start assign a player to an eye. But leave one to kill Ogres so a player per eye except for one player who will have to shoot two. Be ready to assist others if they are having trouble. If you fuck up. You will wipe. So don't fuck up. Now if you finish that part of the fight then you need to collect ammo and other supplies but be wary of the creeping darkness in your buff list. You can refresh it by standing on a plate. When your ready to move on stand on the plate you started on. You will then drop you need to shoot the cysts on Rivens body take note that popping these will release axiom bolts. Once you reach the bottom you go into your respective rooms and repeat the fight(if you do enough damage you can skip the entire fight repeat.)
    </p>

    <h3>Rivens last stands</h3>

    <p>
      Now there are three last stands to work through. The first is to pull you to the ascendant realm. Its a jumping puzzle. It's also timed and your health dosn't regen.
      <br>
       <br>
      Run forward, jump up the platforms, turn left and jump onto a dark ledge. Turn left again and you’ll find more Phalanx above you. Kill them, jump to their platform, turn around, and proceed up until you land on the ring. From here, you can see the Taken Strength in the distance. Run the rest of the way, kill the Phalanx, and jump into the orb to proceed.
      <br>
       <Br>
      The second is just a damage check just shoot her in the mouth.
      <br>
       <Br>

      Ok, get in her mouth and melt the blight in her "heart chamber." Now you can pat yourselves on the back.
    </p>

    <h3>The Heart Run</h3>

      <p>
        Now there is one last part of the last wish. You probably noticed the orb that dropped from the heart. One of you have been chosen (Equip wave clear supers) when you want to start have the chosen pick up the heart orb. And start running exit her mouth everyone should use their supers to murder everything in sight. Now the trick for this is to stay close enough so that your in the dome but far enough that you arn't pulled in with the weilder. You will run back into the vault room enter the open door and go the long way around. Then drop down the hole in the zone with the stairs. Then dunk at the techiun bowl.
      </p>

      <h4>The heart of the matter</h4>

      <p>
        When you get pulled in as I said before. You will find yourself in an arena with taken strength laying about when you collect all the strength it resets the weilders timer (which they should be reading aloud for the team) a good method is to have the first person pulled act as the triggerer. When a person gets pulled have them grab taken strength but leave one to act as the trigger. When the timer gets very low have them get the strength. An if you do it right. Then you should make it to the bowl on the final person.

    <h1>Scourge of the Past</h1>

      <p>Avaliable through the EDZ</p>

    <h3>Encounter One: City Map</h3>

      <p>
        If you make your way across the rooftops you will come to a set of devices guarded by fallen. Once they are dealt with a battery will drop. Insert this into the egg like device. Now figure out which way is north most people assign the Schnell building as north. Now leave a map reader and a guard. What your going to do is hunt the enemy's marked on the map each will drop two batteries one will be returned to the map and the other will be taken to one of four holes. repeat until none of the battery carriers remain then drop down the now open hole into the maze. part of the fun is figuring out the maze so no help for that. when you get to the room with all the pillars the entrance you want is on the right side of the room.
      </p>

    <h3>Encounter Two: Storm Drain Dash</h3>

    <p>
      This next section is rather linear. The hard part is not dying on the way. You can start it by meleeing both consoles that have the fallen hand on them. There are six switches hidden in the race. You can hit them by driving near them. They unlock a chest at the end, which gives a chance to obtain an exotic Sparrow. Thats all there really is to this section.
    </p>

    <h3>Encounter three: freeing the boss</h3>

    <p>
      The next part has you repeating the first part but this time your spawning tanks shoot the thing in the center of the map with the rocket pods first then lay into it with the main gun. Eventually it will break and you can move on.
    </p>

    <h3>Insurrection Prime </h3>

    <p>
      So there are three roles. Reader, Sniper and Runners. The reader is the one who will stay on the map and calling out breserkers for runners. They will also have to deal with a servitor that spawns. The servitor will try to scramble your map. Just finish it off with a shotgun like Ikelos.<br><br>

      The snipers will be countering fallen snipers that will appear on the rooftops and will be poping Insurection's sheild generators (the small blue bars that cover the body).
      <br>
       <br>
      The runners will be killing beserkers that spawn and collecting batteries to power generators around the arena. The batteries need to be pick up one at a time for the reader to be able distinguish the batteries on the map. The reader need to direct you to the correct generators. The last one to deposit their battery gets a tank. Drive it around the map and try to manuver the boss into a easily dammagable position. Then shoot it to start the damage phase. Remember communication is key.
    </p>

    <h4>Damage phase</h4>

    <p>
      The damage phase has a unique feature of the C-A-P buffs. The buffs being Continous Angular and Parellel. Standing near a player with the same buff will boost your damage significantly. Standing near a player with a different buff will damage you over time. Basicly designate a spot that players with a certain buff will go. Dropping wells on these spots will help tremendously. Your buffs will change when a burst of light goes off.
    </p>

<!--Garden of salvation-->
  <div id="garden" class="guides">
    <div class="textbox , borders">
    <h1>Garden of salvation</h1>

    <p>Avaliable through the Moon</p>

    <h4>Tethering</h4>
    <p>
      Garden has a system called tethering where there are power lines running between players this is used in two ways directing power to doorways and creating circuits for the divinity exotic. You can tell when you need to use tethering because there will be a small construct that looks like a cross made out of metal beams.
    </p>

    <h3>Encounter one:</h3>

      <p>
        First split your team into two groups one group will move into the next room (tethering might be required to get in) and clear the enemies there until an angelic spawns, while the group that stays will distract the boss. Those distracting the boss need to scoop its voltic charge but also need to communicate because there's a cooldown on the charge scooping so you need to rotate. You need to scoop the charge fast cause it will wipe. After enough of this you reach the top of a plateau. Chase the boss across the plateau. Until the boss leaves then drop down into the hole in the floor.
      </p>

    <h3>Encounter two: tower defence.</h3>

      <p>
        eventually you will reach a area that has three lanes split the team into two groups the defenders and the roamers the defender will be four players taking a corner each while the roamers are the rest of the players they will be moving between two of the corners providing support. Roamers should grab the buff and help the player on the other side of their assigned lane clear their units of sheilds so they can clear the wave. Once the walls fall move to defend the center pylon.
      </p>

    <h3>Harpy Boss Encounter</h3>

    <p>
      Split your team into two groups again the gambit team and the babysitters.
      the gambit team will need to kill minotaurs which will drop motes. bank these at the conflux that was selected(big blue beam to the sky). note that banking motes will cause a expolding harpy called a supplicant to spawn and hunt you down.

      The babysitter team will chase the boss(goldfish). Then pick up the voltaic charge. The person that picked up the charge will be caught in a sheild. They will see a diffrent harpy from the one that the others will see they need to callout inner or outer depending on the lights. The team then needs to shoot the correct lights. While this is happening the gambit team should be charging the pylon with motes.

      Once the pylon is charged the goldfish should go running towards the pylon this leads the damage phase, the babysitter team should beat the boss back to pylon. now you need to shoot all the eyes that appear, then the harpyfish's vex tank will appear. lay into it with dps weapons, you also need to follow the boss down the alley because walls will appear in the alley blocking you.

    </p>

    <h3>Final Boss Encounter:</h3>

      <p>
        alright four teams: defender team(2), blue team(2), red team(2) and tether team(4) feel free to overlap members. defender team will stay on he feild defend pylons and rebuild platforms. red team will be collecting motes from the red portal. blue from the blue.

        as the fight an Angelic will spawn kill this then shoot the light on the Bosses shoulder then a red portal will spawn where it lands. red team enters and collects their motes when everyone has their motes they need to call out so the people still on the field can shoot the shoulder again to pull them back, the team then banks at their apropriate pylon. then blue should do the same. until both pylons are charged. when the boss is ready for the damage phase. a tether point will appear in front of the boss you need to tether to the same colored pylon.
         <br> <br>
        there are some things that should be noted when doing this encounter:
        <br><br>
        when banking, a Cyclops will spawn kill it it will be a hassle.
        <br>
        you can trick the red side into respawning the ads by climbing up onto the branch behind the arena. you can fill the red bank in one go with this trick I believe that you need one of the garden mods to do it though.
        <br>
        you have to rebuild using the pylons after the damage phase you don't have a big window though.
