        <ol>
          <li>A Well Warlock:<br>
          having a Warlock running the Well of Radience(middle tree dawnblade) to drop during the damage phase will improve results dramaticly.

          <br>
          <br>
          <li>A bubble titan: <br>

          <br>
          <li>a high dps weapon:<br>

      <h3>Capture the flag</h3>
            <p> Its time to play a game of capture the flag. </p>
            <p>The starting point changes every weekly reset each door leads to an activity. you need to split your team into two groups. </p>
            <p>One group is going to capture flags from standard bearers around the map and deliver the flags to the door of the activity that your going to.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the other team will be defending the captured flags from cabal trying to retake the flag.</p>


              <h3>Guard Dogs</h3>
                <p>Your first step is to clear the room of enemies.now head to the back of the room. you'll need to seperate your team again into a duo and a group of four. the duo will grab the two crystals while the four head down the hole in the roof and grab the four spores from the room. Your goal here is to charge the spores from the flowers aroud the room. looking towards the door you came in there are six flowers two immediantly left and right of the safe room on the right side theres one in the cave and one at the end of the room. on the left the flowers are just along the left wall. sneak around the dogs(NOTE: do NOT touch on the trails of footprints SECOND NOTE: walk do not run) these spores will boost your damage use these damage boosts to kill the dogs. when you start your attack on the dogs(or get spotted) a timer will start you need to get back into the spore room before the timer runs out our you all die. once all the dogs are dead the encounter is complete. </p>

              <h3> Royal Baths</h3>
                <p>so there as you enter the baths on the left and right there are going to be four baths. two on the left and two on the right. with a large room in the center. what your ging to do is split the party up so that there is a guardian on each platform. the two remaining guardians will be the runners. what your going to do is raise the chains on the sides of the capture points. but there a catch the liquid on the floor will drain your health. you've probaly noticed the orb floating above the capture point. this will give you immunity to the drain effect. there is also a orb in the center room. so the two runners will be assigned to a side of the room each. then they will dimiss a plate holder who will then run to the center room and grab the buff orb. and dimiss the other plate holder  </p>

              <h3>The Gauntlet </h3>
                  <p>so you start on the elevator taking you to the gauntlet room the team is goin to need to split up again assign two people to each section of the room(the sections are the bits of the room with the three triangles) you have to stand on the pedistals( floor circles) there are going to be cabal psions with white sheilds. the ones on the ground need to be melee'd but the ones that appear in the air can be shot. someone will then go into the gauntlet. the goal? get to the end. if you make it return to the alter in the center of the room, repeat until. all the lights are on. </p>

                <h3>Calus</h3>
                  <p>the fight starts when you shoot the cup out of calus hand. then you are sent to the mindscape three orbs will dictate who leaves(jump into them) they just go into ad clear the people in the mindscape need to kill psions before you're thrown into air(which is certain death) you need to call out the symbol on your calus head. one person on the outside needs to punch the psion on the plate of the symbol that was not called out. the people in the mindscape will be swarmed by little skulls shoot as many as you can.</p>

                <h4>The Damage Phase.</h4>
                  </p> stand on a plate and start to damage calus. when he charges an attack switch plates and continue. when he reaches about %50 health he will reveal his "true nature" shifting the critical spot from his head to his chest. </p>

  <div id="wish" class="guides">
    <div class="textbox">
    <h1>Last Wish</h1>

    <p>note: accessable through the Dreaming City.</p>

    <h4>Eyes of riven:</h4>

    <p>there are special enemys called eyes of riven. they drop an orb that will function as a weapon theres a primary fire, you can use your grenade for a slam and you can hit your super to throw the orb. this will be used for some mechanics.</p>

    <h3>The first encounter: kalli</h3>

      <p>when you first enter the room the first thing you will notice is the big pit in the center of the room surounded by hanging symbols. there are also nine plates around the room with symbols above them. look its not that hard just step on the plates of the corrisponding symbols and don't die until a knight spawns then kill the knight to clear the plate. occasionally kalli will come over to throw salt on you but she can be repelled with the classic method of pretending your not home and hiding(getting off the plate) or with bullets. </p>

    <h4>Damage phase: </h4>

      <p>Once all the sybols have been clensed and the words "kalli is summoning an ontological weapon" then you can start damaging her go though standard damage phase procedure. and defeat kallis.</p>

    <h3>Encounter Two: shuro chi</h3>

      <p>your going to want a mix of wave clear and boss damage here. top tree storm caller or a middle tree sunbreaker do wonders. Now there will be a timer on the left of your screne if that hits zero you will wipe. once youre done clearing three crystals will appear around shuro chi choose three players to be crystal bearers they will stand on the plates around the boss and fire the crystal at the player to their left this will cause the boss's sheild to drop. crystal bearers need to be quick when dropping the sheilds because standing on the plates will damage them. you've probably noticed that the bosses health bar is segmented you need to do one segment each one of these damage phases. once either you die or you remove a segment of shuros health bar she will switch songs. the eye of riven knight that appeared dropped an orb when she switchs songs the player using the orb should hit their super button to throw the orb at shuro interrupting the wipe. chase and repeat. soon you will reach a puzzle room you need to stand on the plates corrisponding to the missing parts of the mural. you also need to stand on the plates at the same time. then you just repeat for all the segments. </p>

    <h3>Encounter three: Morgeth the thicc</h3>

      <p>Forout the fight with Morgeth he will be gaining strength a good run will see you entering the damage phase when he is at about 30% strength. <br> <br> Triggering the damage phase for Morgeth requires you to collect taken strength stop Morgeth from collecting it. You can only hold two without dying. Morgeth will occasionaly target a guardian who has taken strength traping them in a tornado. you can use the eye of riven weapon to free them from the tornado, this come with a cost of gain said persons stacks of taken strength. becareful when "cleansing" a player because if you pick up another stack of taken strength you will die. you can start the damage phase with a taken strength buff that spawns where the buff that started the fight did. 
      </p>

      <h4>Damaging Morgeth:</h4>

      <p>there are two options when damaging Morgeth the first is a one phase strategy and a multi phase strategy. <br><br> 
      
      The one-Phase Strategy is just placing a well of radience halfway between the rally flag point and Morgeth. have player run code of the commander to block axion darts that will be sent towards you. while the rest of the team lay into Morgeth. <br><br>
      
      The multi-phase strategy is pretty much the same but you throw a eye of riven at him before he reach 100% or the eye of riven buff gets to its tenth stack then repeat until dead</p>

    <h3>encounter four: The vault</h3>

    <p>step one: choose three people to read. the other three just kill things like the unimportant barbarians you are. choose a platform around the center of the room now read your middle symbol out loud use the guide below: 
      <br>

      <br>
    the person with the symbol that you called out on the left or right of their panel needs to call out that they have that symbol then the person with the symbol in the middle will have to deliver the buff that their plate needs.<br>
    
    if the persons symbol is called out on the left then they need a penumbra buff.<br><br>

    if it's called out on the right then it needs an antumbra <br><br>


    now the actual fight starts, after a short while two of the side rooms will be walled off the team needs to move into this room and clear adds. in the room will be your old friend: the eye of riven leave him till last. when he's all that remains every one except for the one whos plate belongs to that section of the room. when the buff is picked up a wall will rise blocking off that room. but another will open tell the player on the inside what section is opened so they can exit through it and dunk at their plate(Grenade button). there are also knights that will come to destroy a plate. KILL THEM BEFORE THEY REACH THE PLATE. this is very important if you fail to stop them you will wipe. repeat this three more times and you'll be done.
